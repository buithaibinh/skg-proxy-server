# The `assets/ directory` contains by convention every asset that you want the build tool (Vite or Webpack) to process.

### Example

For example, referencing an image file that will be processed if a build tool is configured to handle this file extension:

```html
<template>
  <img src="~/assets/img/nuxt.png" alt="Discover Nuxt 3" />
</template>
```
